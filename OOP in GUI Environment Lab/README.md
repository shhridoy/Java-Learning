## CSTE-2208: OOP in GUI environment

1.	Write a program that inputs one number consisting of five digits from the user, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by three spaces each. For example, if the user types in the number 42339, the program should print

 
  
  2.

  
  
  Create a class
  called Invoice that a hardware
  store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of
  information as instance variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double). Your class should have a
  constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method
  for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the
  invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns
  the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be
  set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0.
  Write a program named InvoiceTest
  that demonstrates class Invoice’s
  capabilities.

   

  
 
 
  
  3.

  
  
  Create a class
  called Employee that includes
  three instance variables—a first name (type
  String), a last name (type String)
  and a monthly salary (double).
  Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide
  a set and a get method for each
  instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.0.
  Write a program named EmployeeTest
  that demonstrates class Employee’s
  capabilities. Create two Employee
  objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each
  Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.

   

  
 
 
  
  4.

  
  
  Create a class
  called Date that includes three
  instance variables—a month (type int),
  a day (type int) and a year (type int). Provide a constructor
  that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values
  provided are correct. Provide a set
  and a get method
  for each instance variable. Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by
  forward slashes (/). Write a program named DateTest that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.

   

  
 
 
  
  5.

  
  
  (Credit Limit
  Calculator) Write
  a program that determines whether any of several department-store customers
  has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the
  following facts are available:

  a) account
  number

  b) balance at
  the beginning of the month

  c) total of all
  items charged by the customer this month

  d) total of all
  credits applied to the customer’s account this month

  e) allowed
  credit limit.

  The program
  should input all these facts as integers, calculate the new balance (=
  beginning balance + charges – credits), display the new balance and
  determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit.
  For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should
  display the message "Credit limit exceeded".

  (Sales
  Commission Calculator) A large company pays its salespeople on
  a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their
  gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth
  of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650.
  You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The
  values of these items are as follows:

  Item     Value

  1           239.99

  2           129.75

  3           99.95

  4         350.89

  Write a program
  that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week and calculates and displays
  that salesperson’s earnings. There’s no limit to the number of items that can
  be sold.

   

  
 
 
  
  7.

  
  
  (Find the
  Largest Number) The process of finding the largest value is used
  frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that determines
  the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each
  salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest.

  Write a program that
  inputs a series of 10 integers and determines and prints the largest integer.
  Your program should use at least the following three variables:

  a) counter: A
  counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been input
  and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).

  b) number: The
  integer most recently input by the user.

  c)
  largest: The largest number found so far.

   

  
 
 
  
  8.

  
  
  (Palindromes) A palindrome is
  a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For
  example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321,
  55555, 45554 and 11611. 

  Write a program
  that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. If
  the number is not five digits long, display an error message and allow the
  user to enter a new value.

   

  
 
 
  
  9.

  
  
  (Printing the
  Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number) Write a program that inputs an integer
  containing only 0s and 1s (i.e., a binary integer) and prints its decimal
  equivalent. [Hint: Use the remainder and division operators to pick
  off the binary number’s digits one at a time, from right to left. In the
  decimal number system, the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1 and
  the next digit to the left a positional value of 10, then 100, then 1000, and
  so on. The decimal number 234 can be interpreted as 4 * 1 + 3 * 10 + 2 * 100.
  In the binary number system, the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1,
  the next digit to the left a positional value of 2, then 4, then 8, and so
  on. The decimal equivalent of binary 1101 is 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8,
  or 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 or, 13.]

  (Enforcing
  Privacy with Cryptography) The explosive growth of Internet
  communications and data storage on Internet-connected computers has greatly
  increased privacy concerns. The field of cryptography is concerned with
  coding data to make it difficult (and hopefully—with the most advanced
  schemes—impossible) for unauthorized users to read. 

   

  A company that
  wants to send data over the Internet has asked you to write a program that
  will encrypt it so that it may be transmitted more securely. All the data is
  transmitted as four-digit integers. Your program should read a four-digit integer
  entered by the user and encrypt it as follows:

   Replace each digit with the result of adding
  7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10.
  Then swap the first digit with the third, and swap the second digit with the
  fourth. Then print the encrypted integer. 

  Write a separate
  program that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypts it (by
  reversing the encryption scheme) to form the original number.

   

  
 
 
  
  11.

  
  
  (Perfect
  Numbers) An
  integer number is said to be a perfect number if its factors,
  including

  1 (but not the
  number itself), sum to the number. For example, 6 is a perfect number,
  because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. 

  Write a program
  that includes a method isPerfect that determines if parameter number is a
  perfect number. Use this method to display all the perfect numbers between 1
  and 1000. Display the factors of each perfect number to confirm that the
  number is indeed perfect.

  (Rectangle
  Class) Create
  a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, each of which defaults to
  1. Provide methods that calculate the rectangle’s perimeter and area. It has set
  and get methods for both length and width. The set methods
  should verify that length and width are each floating-point numbers larger
  than 0.0 and less than 20.0.Write a program to test class Rectangle.

   

  
 
 
  
  13.

  
  
  (Complex
  Numbers) Create
  a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex numbers.
  Complex numbers have the form

  realPart + imaginaryPart
  * i

  where i is
  

  Write a program
  to test your class. Use floating-point variables to represent the private
  data of the class. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class
  to be initialized when it’s declared. Provide a no-argument constructor with
  default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public methods
  that perform the following operations:

  a) Add two
  Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are
  added together.

  b) Subtract two
  Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from the
  real part of the left operand, and the imaginary part of the right operand is
  subtracted from the imaginary part of the left operand.

  c)
  Print Complex numbers in the form (realPart, imageinaryPart).

   

  
 
 
  
  14.

  
  
  Write an
  inheritance hierarchy for classes Quadrilateral, Trapezoid, Parallelogram, Rectangle
  and Square. Use Quadrilateral as the superclass of the hierarchy. Create and
  use a Point class to represent the points in each shape. Make the hierarchy
  as deep (i.e., as many levels) as possible. Specify the instance variables
  and methods for each class. The private instance variables of Quadrilateral
  should be the x-y coordinate pairs for the four endpoints of the
  Quadrilateral.

  Write
  a program that instantiates objects of your classes and outputs each object’s
  area (except Quadrilateral).

   

  
 
 
  
  15.

  
  
  (Project:
  ShapeHierarchy) Implement the Shape hierarchy shown in the following
  figure. Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain method getArea to calculate
  the area of the two-dimensional shape. Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have
  methods getArea and getVolume to calculate the surface area and volume,
  respectively, of the three-dimensional shape. Create a program that uses an
  array of Shape references to objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy.
  In the loop that processes all the shapes in the array, determine whether
  each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a ThreeDimensionalShape. If it’s a TwoDimensionalShape,
  display its area. If it’s a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area and
  volume.

  20.

  
  
  (Temperature
  Conversion) Write
  a temperature-conversion application that converts from

  Fahrenheit to Celsius.
  The Fahrenheit temperature should be entered from the keyboard (via a JTextField).
  A JLabel should be used to display the converted temperature. Use the following
  formula for the conversion:

  Celsius = (5/9)*(Fahrenheit-32)

   

  
 
 
  
  21.

  
  
  (Comparing
  Strings) Write
  a program that uses String method
  compareTo to compare two strings input by the user. Output whether the first
  string is less than, equal to or greater than the second.

   

  
 
 
  
  22.

  
  
  (Comparing
  Portions of Strings) Write a program that uses String method            regionMatches to compare two
  strings input by the user. The application should input the number of
  characters to be compared and the starting index of the comparison. The
  application should state whether the strings are equal. Ignore the case of
  the characters when performing the comparison.

   

  
 
 
  
  23.

  
  
  (Displaying
  Strings in Uppercase and Lowercase) Write an application that inputs
  a line of text and outputs the text twice—once in all uppercase letters and
  once in all lowercase letters.

   

  
 
 
  
  24.

  
  
  (Searching
  Strings) Write
  an application that inputs a line of text and a search character and uses
  String method indexOf to determine the number of occurrences of the character
  in the text.

   

  
 
 
  
  25.

  
  
  (Tokenizing and
  Comparing Strings) Write an application that reads a line of text,
  tokenizes the line using space characters as delimiters and outputs only
  those words beginning with the letter "b".

   

  
 
 
  
  26.

  
  
  (Creating
  Three-Letter Strings from a Five-Letter Word) Write an
  application that reads a

  five-letter word
  from the user and produces every possible three-letter string that can be
  derived from the letters of that word. For example, the three-letter words
  produced from the word “bathe” include “ate,” “bat,” “bet,” “tab,” “hat,”
  “the” and “tea.”
